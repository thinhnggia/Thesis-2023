2993	2	"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves."	3	2	2	2	2	2
2998	2	"Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to."	3	2	2	2	2	1
2999	2	"I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it"	3	3	2	2	2	2
3002	2	"I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them"	3	3	3	2	2	2
3003	2	"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values"	4	3	2	2	2	2
3021	2	"In this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip. People say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. Its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?                                                                             If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc.. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actualy! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!                                                        There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. We should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      No we should'nt have censorship in our libraries! Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. That would take to long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!"	4	4	3	3	3	3
3022	2	"Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area"	4	5	4	5	4	5
3033	2	"Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes"	4	5	4	3	3	3
3041	2	"There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good"	4	5	4	3	3	3
3055	2	"If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf? I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music.      Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.          Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through.     Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want.     Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended. Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3057	2	"I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.     As an example some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.      Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it."	3	2	1	2	2	2
3064	2	"I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine.      You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you.     If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to."	3	3	3	3	3	3
3074	2	"Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene @MONTH1 have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons taht were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the imaortance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.     Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understatnding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inapproriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view @MONTH1 one day lead to the solution of problems in out world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.     I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.     Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly becme very boring. During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote.This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.     All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freeedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?"	4	4	3	4	4	4
3078	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?   Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong. well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant .  I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves.  Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me.   I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too. And that's is more inappropriatefor kids. People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too. the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information.  I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it. that's some things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us"	3	1	1	1	1	1
3087	2	"AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL, BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY. ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA, BUT, IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE?     MANY LIBRARIES @MONTH1 POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL, AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT? IN A MODERN WORLD, THERE'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO OLD PEOPLE AND VIEWERS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. YES, I AGREE SME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS THAT MAINSTREAM MATERIAL, BUT ON A WHOLE, WHO CARES?I MEAN, MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T. I KNOW I DON'T.

3101	2	"No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.       They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age.           Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards.     Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to"	3	3	2	2	3	3
3107	2	"Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living."	3	5	4	4	4	4
3108	2	"Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves?     In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible"	3	4	4	4	4	4
3116	2	"I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them"	3	3	3	3	3	4
3119	2	"There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves."	4	4	5	5	4	5
3121	2	"I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage.     To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did.     As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them.      However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public."	4	5	5	4	4	4
3122	2	"Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age?      Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling.     Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material?      In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I dont think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if its all taken off"	4	3	3	4	4	3
3123	2	"I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world."	4	3	4	3	4	4
3127	2	"There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library.     A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf."	3	4	4	4	4	4
3128	2	"Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way.     The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive in religious ways. A person @MONTH1 believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some @MONTH1 say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it.      Books @MONTH1 even be inappropriate for little kids. It @MONTH1 have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book @MONTH1 contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books.     Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that @CAPS1 wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents @MONTH1 feel the same way.     Magazines @MONTH1 also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it @MONTH1 not be suitable for everyone.     Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely"	4	4	4	5	4	3
3130	2	"offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read"	4	4	4	3	3	2
3133	2	"To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax.    So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service.    The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.    This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is"	4	4	4	3	4	3
3144	2	"Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.       In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1. In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant.    For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.     I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it."	4	3	3	3	3	3
3148	2	"i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amenment which is freedom of speech we should be able to put anything in books, magazines,music,movies, and etc.. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, depends on your point of views.     My first reason is the first amenment which is freedon of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books it will go farther than that and it will come to a point where the first amenment will become cease.      In my culmination I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amenment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views."	3	2	2	2	2	3
3149	2	"You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them."	3	2	2	2	2	2

Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.           Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online.      Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books.    I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other.           In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it"	4	3	3	3	3	3
3154	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves!"	3	2	2	2	2	3
3160	2	"What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home.     I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle.     If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, i would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think?      Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way. Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schdule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop some one from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think"	3	2	2	3	4	5
3161	2	"I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs.     Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs? dust? Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent. This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left.     Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it? No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything.     These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want. Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better.     After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want."	3	4	4	4	3	2
3174	2	"I do believe that some places have magizines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelfs. Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it. Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it? Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary.     Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids? i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you. I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies.      So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern. I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor"	3	3	2	2	2	2
3177	2	"The way i see it movies or books shouldnt be taken off the shelf .becouse it should be up to ower own right to take a movie or to tonot take the movie .Also music such as country or sad music ant like movies or books how can u take music of the radio u canot do it .Becouse it dnt matter what u do with the radio shut it off turn it down or change the chanel with the way the world is now days there will all ways be things on the radio that u wont wanna hear and there will be things that u do wanna hear ,thats my opinion about movies and music      Also if there was any way to keep movies away i would probaly have it done there are goood movies and there are bad but one movie that is afensive and shy is (shylo) about the old man hittin the dog and stuff thats verry afensive to some one that was raised around beetings."	1	1	1	1	1	1
3184	2	"Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored. If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community.     Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology. Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant. Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology.      Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents. If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these.     As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up with out censoreship. I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment. I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it.     Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows. But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censoreship is a great tool, if used right"	3	2	2	3	3	2
3187	2	"The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public.       I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for.  Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me.      I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student.      I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities"	3	3	2	2	3	4
3188	2	"I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess."	3	2	2	2	3	2
3197	2	"I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries.   In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction.     If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be to happy. Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that.      People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others.      In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people."	3	2	2	3	3	2
3200	2	"I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public."	4	4	4	4	4	4
3207	2	"Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     Simply follow the rating rules. Take necesary precations. If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy."	3	3	3	3	2	2
3213	2	"I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you."	4	5	4	4	5	4
3218	2	"I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves"	3	4	3	3	3	3
3221	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values.           I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself.      I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room. @CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. @PERSON1 looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. @CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man.      As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture. @CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1. @PERSON1 says, ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom takes  me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up.      A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at @PERSON1 and I said, '@CAPS5'd you give that to her?' @CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks' and aids. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father. @CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago. Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson. He should have just left her alone.      So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3230	2	"I thank that all of the books and movies and more should not  be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see.      They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 want happen again.     The libraries is for freeom to read to do want you want and look up.     In the newspaper and magazines people like to no that happens in the @CAPS1 or to people if its bad or not, because no how that cant happen to them, some people mite thank that people not read watch something but are they to tell what to do they can there own dishens"	2	1	1	1	1	1
3231	2	"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone"	4	3	3	4	3	3
3241	2	yes i thinck they should take efence books off the shelf because little likd read the books then they will probley be tought rong from right. And if the books had vilance then they will thinck tkat is right to.	1	1	1	1	1	1
3244	2	"Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school.      Back in elementary school, I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them.     Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world."	2	3	3	3	3	3
3247	2	"Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive?     I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.     The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.     Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.     So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are.  Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.         I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. That's the end of my conclusion"	4	3	3	3	3	3

If their was to be any cersorship it should be from the parents of a child or if your not a child then you dont need censored. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. Just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather.     Think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. Being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books ive learned alot but I feel as if I went to a librarie to get a book and if censored or taken off the shelf then I will shown a fake world. Once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt consor anything else.     A censored book, movie or whatever it @MONTH1 be could also determin how much someone could learn from it. People go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up.     This is some of meny reasons I think cendor in libraries shouldnt be aloud. Consorship should be chosen by who you are not by outher people. In the end we @MONTH1 never know whats better till we try."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3257	2	"No because the writer is explain th way the story really happend.If ur kid ask u the word tell him/her it not a good word to say, r u can take the book back and get him/her a new one.          Say him/her kids comes home from school and say a couse word and u asked him/her were they learned it from. An they said the teacher said it. U can tell the teacher u dont wounting ur him/her reading that book.                                                                Cousing is a way of explain the story better to them i guess."	1	1	1	1	1	1
3268	2	"Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library"	3	4	4	4	4	4
3291	2	"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them."	5	4	4	5	5	5
3294	2	"I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off.  You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice.      Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers.     I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion.      Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them.     In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. Its just apart of life"	4	3	3	3	3	3
3295	2	"Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.     I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.      Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read.     Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about."	3	3	4	3	4	3
3297	2	"There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age.     The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.     My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not.       My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3302	2	"I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child"	4	5	4	5	4	5
3305	2	"Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places.     Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it.     When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music.     Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter.     Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys.      But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3316	2	"Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too?     Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In @CAPS1 case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text.      Should 'person one' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible.      Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material.      Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median.      Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them. Again, the happy-median.     For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material"	3	2	3	3	3	2
3335	2	"I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs. If you find something offensive then dont pick it up, its that simple. You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to you own personal opinion.     Sure, there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that persons study.      I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way.     There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch.     In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights"	4	3	3	3	4	4
3347	2	"Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken.     I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the @LOCATION1 they should remove material.     Another simple fact is that the constitution @LOCATION1 that we have the freedom of @CAPS1, which basically means we @MONTH1 print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas.     The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic.     So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of the @CAPS1 is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @MONTH1 be assumed 'offensive'."	4	3	3	4	4	5
3354	2	"I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3362	2	"Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2"	4	4	5	5	5	5
3369	2	"All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3376	2	"Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provide a haven where the can get there hands on such things only and no where else, so shouldn't try to take away any of these things from any body.     One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelfs is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feels differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person own choice, which is something we all should strieve not to do. Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother.     Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even weather people realize it or not, and the more oppuntunties a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has infact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decide that the public should not be educate or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a socity that in situration should not hinder a persons ability to learn.     Also I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's is where parents come in. It's there resoponsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone elses. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parents choice as long as it is in aggrement with the law.      These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decided what materials and subjects are put on their shelfs. For some dicsion no one can make to satify everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves."	4	3	3	3	3	3
3383	2	"For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb"	5	5	5	5	4	4
3388	2	"@CAPS1 is the freedom of speech to be able to read, right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.I think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf. Like I said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen. But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone. we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country. such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth. Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch. From these things @CAPS1 shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people @CAPS1 is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day @CAPS1 could effect you."	3	3	2	3	3	3
3391	2	"'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution"	4	3	3	3	3	3
3394	2	"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone."	3	4	4	4	5	4
3395	2	"The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored. I believe that libraries shouldnt have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then thats how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a Right in the @CAPS1. If you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word. That isnt up to the public to make a decision.         Its almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the @ORGANIZATION1. If any word is changed it is a incorrect @ORGANIZATION1. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword whats been written.     Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or dont read it"	3	4	4	4	4	4
3398	2	"Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material.     The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading.     If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however.      Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them.     I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it.      I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see"	4	4	3	3	4	4
3401	2	"I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing. Theres no reason for all that. Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials.     First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it.      Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for. Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them.     For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do? Is it going to make the word a beteter place? I dont think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be. To educate and informate.     In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty. We would also be pretty missinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves"	3	2	2	3	3	2
3409	2	"Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand. If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone.     Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people. In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear. Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm.      Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.      In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.      To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something.  Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity; just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person. These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truely vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the comunities are today."	3	3	3	2	3	3
3416	2	"I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides no ones making you check out that book"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3418	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2"	5	4	4	4	4	4

From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. It always is a terror that falls violently.     Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself.     This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.     History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest.

They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone.          People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 they get ther before me?'.          The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.          If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it. So, libraries need more than one copy.     In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There fighting for a book and you don't whant that. The libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. So, think before yo act. It can be found offensive at time.

3436	2	"I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries. People find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them. I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset.     In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days have a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them. The same with movies. Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested.     If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it. Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it. People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves.     People can make there own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read. Everybody can choose what they prefeir. Everybody has their own opion on things. I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without. Younger people find more interest in the things that seeem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal.      I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want. Lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things. If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries"	4	4	4	3	4	4
3439	2	"I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok. Many people needs to read them and see what they are about. I think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve.          I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.     I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess thats just how it is now a days. You honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.     I do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc. should be removed from the shelves. It could be interesting to someone else but not you. Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material."	3	3	3	3	3	3
3443	2	"Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds"	4	5	5	4	4	4
3446	2	"The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?"	4	3	4	3	4	3
3447	2	"Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @MONTH1 not see any true beauty. But when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truely offended.       When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyones' group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I new it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody.     @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.      @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to lingere for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me. I asked, '@CAPS2 happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay.     I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings"	4	4	3	5	4	5
3448	2	"Dear Newspaper,     I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of redaing material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display.      It is best that they are in a solitare area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. If they watch a movie full of violence, they @MONTH1 feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best.     As a child is grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us, as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You @MONTH1 ask what it is i am speaking about. Well, i believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after affects of their actions.     Suggest that certain material @MONTH1 not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, in which sometimes revole around our every thought.      I do believe that certain media, should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time.                              Sincerely,                 @LOCATION1"	3	3	5	3	4	4
3453	2	"I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them.      Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive"	4	4	4	4	4	4
3455	2	"Librarys have the right to diside how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material @MONTH1 be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials @MONTH1 be as offensive to one perwson, it @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many ohter rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves.      There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. Howver, some materials @MONTH1 be found offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 not be found offensive to others. A library @MONTH1 not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.      A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances. A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive. Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.     Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive. There simply would be nothin left. People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library"	3	2	2	2	3	2
3463	2	"I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people.      One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like.      Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life.       In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will."	3	3	2	3	4	3
3467	2	"Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.     I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think? @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.     I believe censorship is unnessesary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.      Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?     Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read."	4	5	5	5	5	5
3475	2	"I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.  Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere"	2	2	2	2	3	4
3483	2	"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out"	4	5	5	4	5	5
3486	2	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in	1	2	2	2	2	2
3491	2	"I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I think its wrong to do so, because any book should be read know matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone.      Now ive not really seen anything that i'd fine offensive, but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see. But nothing that i found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it."	2	2	3	2	3	2
3493	2	"I think books that have nudity, curse words, or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good. They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older. They just arent appropriate. No childeren should know about drugs, sex, or epspecially gang violence. Its stuff they should never even find out about. So i think we should take them books off the shelf, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy."	2	1	1	3	3	3
3502	2	"Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material.     Everyone is intitled to there own opions. Theycan do and say what they want. Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie.     If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?"	3	4	4	3	3	4
3504	2	"I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay."	4	3	3	3	3	3

I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others.      How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. So that's my perspective on it"	2	1	1	1	3	3
3520	2	"Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican.     Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be.     The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.     I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it"	4	2	3	3	3	2
3523	2	"Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. @DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.      When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.      Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.     What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.     As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1"	4	4	4	4	4	4
3540	2	"Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3542	2	"I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do!     There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated @CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like @NUM1 to rated @CAPS1. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated @CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater.     Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The @CAPS4 of @PERSON1', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of @CAPS4.     I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them.     The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch. When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want."	4	3	3	3	3	3
3544	2	"There are some movies,books,music,etc that @MONTH1 be found  offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the          appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive,then      you shouldn't have read the book.Books,music,and movies are made to entertain you,however,if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you!  I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it.  In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend."	4	3	3	3	3	4
3547	2	"To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide."	4	3	3	3	3	3
3558	2	"Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it"	3	2	2	2	2	3
3561	2	"Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries.     I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material. Then maybe the library should consider removing the item. Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about situation.     In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts"	3	4	3	3	3	4
3564	2	"There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern"	4	3	3	3	4	3
3569	2	"Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion."	3	3	4	3	3	4
3573	2	"In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     Removing items from shelves removes history.  Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    Think about it.  If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  It would cause much argument among people.  Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  People read for enjoyment and knowledge.  They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it."	4	3	4	3	3	5
3579	2	"In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence. Theses books all have history in them of our past. We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historains say, history repeats its self. If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgoten, and/or lost.      Libraries can help us in many different ways. They help us with school projects, bussiness projects, and libraries better our knoweldge as a person. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offesive. The stories of slavory are still taken offensively amoug people @DATE1, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the poeple, we will slip back into that terrible past.      There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better.      There is more than just books at the public library, there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the @CAPS3. Movies that talk about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2. These types of movies can show how horrifying @CAPS4 really is and how cruel people can get. During @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2, there was the @CAPS9 where six million jews lost their lives because one person, @PERSON2, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the @CAPS3 how devestating man can be but people have made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example @PERSON1. One of the greatest findings amoug the @CAPS3.      Music can also be a good way to better ones self. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You dont have to worry about payin for a @MONEY1 cd and you can use it until your done with it then return. Then with how advanced our technokwledge is, people can get cd's to burn on to a computer and put on their ipod or @NUM4 player. Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like.      So, should there be censorship in our libraries? NO! There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our @CAPS3, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of @DATE1 from history we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or gaurdian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from readin to mature thing but still able to get the history he/she needs because as historains always say, history repeats its self and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible. The answer to that is through our history."	4	5	4	5	4	5
3584	2	"TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.

3587	2	Yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human etc. but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gonna learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good. Really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them.	3	2	2	2	2	2
3593	2	"Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it."	4	4	5	4	4	4
3595	2	"Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. ' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book.      I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4"	4	3	3	3	4	4
3599	2	"Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there.  She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove.     They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it.     We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off. That why i think they should be remove"	3	3	3	3	3	2
3602	2	"I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually.     The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose.           The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read.      Then the third  is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose.     The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book.      Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship. The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says."	3	2	2	2	3	2
3604	2	I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it. There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books     If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book.     It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper.     Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them.     So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book	3	3	3	2	2	2
3605	2	"Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers"	3	5	5	4	4	3
3608	2	"Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.      Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?"	4	5	4	5	4	4
3611	2	If you take any of these books off the shelves that would be lik taking away some of our chilldhood. that wuldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was yoour favorite book as a kid.      We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore. the had to make room for other books. So if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books.       I mean how wuld you fel if you couldnt share that with your kids?

3615	2	"No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read."	4	3	3	3	3	3
3620	2	"People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will"	4	3	3	3	3	3
3626	2	"The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them"	5	5	5	5	5	5
3634	2	"Yes  I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out  the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this.     If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken  off the shelf. I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired.     My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3635	2	"Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people."	3	3	2	2	3	3
3644	2	"Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools.          There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life.

3646	2	"In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do."	4	5	4	4	5	5

They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world. because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older. I think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it.

3665	2	"Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons."	3	3	3	2	3	3

I say, 'If  you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get @CAPS1 just beacuse you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1. So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1?' @CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said a pastor was on tv, talkin about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad. He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off tv. But she didn't havve to watch him on tv, she could of watched something else. Nobody made her watch @CAPS1, she chose to watch @CAPS1.     So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you."	2	2	2	2	3	1

A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have.      Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research.      I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together.      The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are.      In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive. It is their job to just offer information"	4	5	5	4	4	5
3673	2	"At my point of viwe i think if materials such as books is offensive to the reader the reader shuld just leve the book allown.Because other readers might just wont to read it.Same thing for music,movies,and magazines, or any thing else just because you fide some offensive it wont be right to take it away from @NUM1,ooo of more people.Also i think if some is offensive to more then one person it shuld not just not be taking away right then in there we as people shuld step up in have a vote or talk about it about the problem.I think it just wont be right for us or to the rest of the wrold and then look at how much work the author hade to put in i never wrot a book but i also know it's not easy to do.Heres a example me and my family want out to eat but we dent no were to eat at so every body was thinking about pizzy but my big brother dent wont to so we dent go out to eat that night because of one person dent wont to thats not fair now is it. So in my conclusino i dont think its wood be ringht to take some away because some body fund it offensive you just got to look at the rest of the wrold you just got to because it wont right  to the rest of us."	3	1	1	1	1	1
3674	2	"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject."	4	5	4	4	5	4
3684	2	"Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children"	3	2	2	2	3	2

So what will make it different if someone writes a book that someone else doesn't like it should not matter if someone does not agree with someone else desion on a book cause someone else might like his or her book.There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc that someone will not like that is just part of life it you ask me. So i think haveing books that some people dont like is a great thing to have in are world. It tell you whether people are going out to see what is going on in are world if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people.There is just one thing that people should allows keep in mind when they are write a movie or even in your local new paper the articles that some people put in the movies and papers are taking a little to far sometimes by what people say. I do bevlive that there should be a line as to what you can and not write in a book and i think that should be deminded by the write of his best judgement.Why do some people complane about everything that is meant to be told to them is because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they dont want other people to know there past if it is bad or of sumthing tragic has happend top them whether it be in ther family something bad happend to them but i think if somebody would talk to this person they would not get so mad at someone for speeching the truth to the public.Well you have heard my side of the store on what i think about peoplle getting mad at other people for what they say and i belive that what you say is very true that we do ahve a freddom in this country."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3692	2	"Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right. It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others. I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier.     Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories. People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else. Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand. They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others.     Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way. People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions.     Some people are just stubborn. They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others.     In conlusion I do think censorship is important but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas. If people sought to understand, ;ooked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better"	4	3	3	3	3	3
3693	2	"I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content"	3	3	2	2	3	3
3695	2	"When people  think of libraries  they picture  this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet.Or they just picture this books every where . But libraries today has be way more improved and advance with music,movies,and etc.     When i was  young I never really like libraries  because they seem boring to me.Thats why I wasn't good read either until I was in the six grade because I discover the library was actually cool place. They different thing to do like look up books,music,or movies  you can check out the libraries. Or sometimes you migth have magazines you can check out too.                                Then at the libraries there people who don't like it because of the music,movies,and etc.This reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens.Thats why the faithful and ones go to the libraries everyday take the new things offense to the library.     When it all boil down this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was offense book talking about the whites treated the negreos back then. The reason say that is because old tradition in the library are like the whites in the story and the  new things in library  are like the negreos who was outcasted by the whites.Then in book it took one little girl to settle diference and knows whats right and wrong.     Thats why I think instead of banning or remove stuff we should have disscusion.Which we can come to adgreement keep new ideas in the libraries.When do keep the ideas maybe we can make a section for thet new ideas so the people comes to library wouldn't get offend"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3700	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.  Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it.   I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.       One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them.  First of all, children often follow after what they see.  For example, adutly trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.     Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music.  Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles.  For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world.  It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment.  Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.     In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do.  Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?  Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.     So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship.  We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries?  Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc."	4	4	4	5	5	5

I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 be offensive to a single person, or group of people.      Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, @CAPS2 I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive.           Also, there are many people that find The @CAPS3 offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature.     Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs.          As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture. That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!"	3	3	3	4	4	4

While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year.

One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things.

I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question.

So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive.

You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.          If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else."	3	1	1	2	2	2

But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad?

Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor.  Which  means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy.       Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them. The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them.     As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books.  Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them, but some poeple like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it. does that seem fair??     Now does some of those books seem a little better now?  Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy  reading those novels.

3762	2	"I think censorship  should be allowed and the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read.I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of hte dislike.Many people think by looking a diffrent types of  materials can have you look for the right imformation.I feel that if you limit the books and libraries that whould be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve.Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wonted is not there and the local libraries. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they wont and need.Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed"	2	2	1	1	1	1
3766	2	"Certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature. The music will always have ratings, just like movies. They dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice.      Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels.      If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3770	2	"Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored.     Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive.      Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society"	4	4	5	5	5	5
3784	2	"In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where"	5	6	5	6	5	5
3789	2	"They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it"	3	4	3	4	4	4
3807	2	"Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone.     I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people.      I do beleive, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwated material.      To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different veiws, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left"	4	5	4	4	5	5
3810	2	"I think that libraries should not remove material such as book, music, movies, magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading. Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book, then i will go look at magazines, movies, music. Thier are alot of movies out right now, and now u can go cheak them out. Music is the same way. I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it. Im sure that they have edgucational books, movies and magazines.                                                                                  If  people take out stuff that kids and teens like. Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too. I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for. The movies are easy to find. and its quick. If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public.                                                          Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people. The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more. I really hope the people make the right choice"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3815	2	"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads.     Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book.      Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not.      Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't.          There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like."	4	3	3	3	4	4
3821	2	"Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others.     If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers.     Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction."	3	4	4	4	4	4
3825	2	"It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire.     These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.     The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not.      In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression"	4	5	5	5	5	5
3827	2	"A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules."	4	4	4	3	4	3
3843	2	"When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole.     The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.     The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them."	3	4	4	4	4	4
3847	2	"As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs. A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too.      Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how do this and that. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book. They see the cover that intrigue them. They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should.      Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow"	4	5	4	4	4	4
3849	2	"Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely."	4	3	3	3	4	3
3856	2	"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go."	4	3	3	3	4	4
3857	2	"I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that book uses the @CAPS4 word to describe african americans, but when that book was published that was common talk now people look at you like you have just murdered there first born child if youu were to use that word.      For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids.     I know that during @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 over in germany many books were banded because they had something to do with catholicism or something that @PERSON3 believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time alot of what @PERSON2 wrote was banned for using the @CAPS4 word but people have to realize that when @PERSON2 was alive that was everyday laungage.     As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned.     As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist.     I dont think that movies shouyld be banned form the libraries because of violence or anytning of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contians anything of the nature of pornagraphy but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway  so they are a step ahead of me.     I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's I do not get offended at a lot of things"	3	2	3	3	3	3
3860	2	"Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys.      I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.     Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there. Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it.     In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading. Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3861	2	"Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it.     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like."	3	2	2	2	3	3
3862	2	"Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read"	5	5	4	4	4	4
3867	2	"In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear.         Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people. The words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence.      I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me.      In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them"	3	4	4	4	4	4
3874	2	"Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people @MONTH1 not realize it but they do. Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf.     Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it. Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting. If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. people can  be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books. I think moives would offend more than a book would.     In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this word way to easy. One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs"	3	2	2	2	3	2
3879	2	i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?	1	1	1	1	1	1
3883	2	"My say would be no. becuse all that was history, say you hade like a kkk thing or anything like that. say you had a wighting aport but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes,dates and other thing"	1	1	1	1	1	1
3885	2	"If I was givin the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on @CAPS1 are quite correct. I would defiently reccomend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions,backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books.      People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.'  @CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before.      Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book.      Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in  the world today"	3	3	3	3	4	4
3888	2	"Should offenive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an american citizen.  If you think books should be censored, then think about this.  Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive?  I do not think so, those words give power to the book.  @CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture.  Taking away these books will limit education.  Books should not be censored.         I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man.  In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently.  A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story.  I agree with the latter statement.  The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers.  I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word.  The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then.  When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.       Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship.  On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate.  It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch.  If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it.  The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents.  Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it."	5	5	4	4	5	4
3889	2	"Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves.     The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' @CAPS1 is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new.     The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored.      The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend.     While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having  a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help?  Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries"	4	5	5	5	5	4
3892	2	"Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech.     In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like.     So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff. but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art."	3	3	2	3	3	3
3906	2	"No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.     The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.     Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.     A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.      Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?"	4	5	5	4	5	5
3911	2	"I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries.  I think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it dosen't mean remove it.  They don't have to read that book.  If I did like a book i just don't like it.       everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into.  Like im in to freaky novels.  Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels.  In I mite not be into what they are into.  Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like.  I can say I am in to abnormal stories.  I like fiction stories then nonfiction.       My most favorite novels is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'.  Most people would want to remove the stories with bad lauguage or vocabulary off the shelevs.  I know a lot of poeple that are into those kind of stories.  I think that would be unfair to do that.  Why take away what they like in not what you like.  Like I am into all kind of sex books.  Some poeple wouldn't want those books on the shelves either.         Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore.  I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read.  Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you.  How would you feel if that was to happen to you.  So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of veiw.         You should look at all the possitive way first.  Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books.  Not olny would it effect the read but the person who wrote the book.  You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people.  You would be putting someone out their job.  You could mess up someones family of living.  You could take away somones belifes.          You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad.  You can drive a person crazy.  You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all.  Books could be a way people escape the real world.  Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way.         I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at.  Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc.......  Life is hard in books makes it eaiser for some people"	3	2	2	2	2	2
3927	2	"Dear newspaper editor,      @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers.     Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like. Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems.      Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religon or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alchol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left @CAPS3 be childrens books. Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well. We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature.     Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores.      This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we dont need to censor anything, as we are a free country.      So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, '@CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer."	3	3	4	2	3	3
3932	2	"Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore"	4	5	5	5	5	5
3938	2	"I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen"	3	2	2	2	3	2

Or be around.     One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my @CAPS4 is the @CAPS5 that my @CAPS6 gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my @CAPS4 have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time. But we just cant get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that @CAPS5 and just grab ahold of it. @CAPS1 me and my @CAPS9 do not like that. So we say something. Thats one thing that we @CAPS10 like for anyone to touch. Because it means so much to us!      Most @CAPS3 think we are crazy because we @CAPS10 like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there is other @CAPS3 around this area that is more crazy about there things being touched. For example: ' @CAPS10 be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I @CAPS10 want you to knock it off, so get away from it! ' That is something that my bestfriends @CAPS11 had said before. & she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean its just how we feel about everything around us that means alot.     But to get back to the situation about why do @CAPS3 get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and thats where they have been for years and years. Its because it means so much to them. Its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, & when I say means alot to them, I mean a bunch bunch!! There just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what there trying to say to you. Because it could mean so much. & you could get to the point to watch out for it also. Just to help out.     But the store that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing. & she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her. You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of @CAPS3 that have impotant things in there life, & you could be one of them. Just try to see & feel how alot of other @CAPS3 do around the world around you. Just have to remember whats important to someone and help keep an eye out with them. & because a good friend to everybody else."	3	2	2	2	2	2
3943	2	"What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one"	4	3	3	3	5	4
3945	2	"We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It @MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it."	3	4	3	4	4	4
3951	2	"Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish."	5	6	5	6	6	6

Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, Then it shouldn't be their, @CAPS1 my oppinion.     Parents @MONTH1 think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. @CAPS1 not their choice though. Anything is alowed to be at a libray. If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. Help them pick out a book.     In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. Kid or if your an adult. If your not alowed to get, then why is it their? I dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? @CAPS1 my oppinion though"	2	1	1	1	2	1
3953	2	"'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book"	4	3	3	3	4	3
3959	2	"If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too."	3	4	4	3	3	4
3977	2	"I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin"	4	5	4	5	5	4
3979	2	"Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth."	3	3	2	3	3	3
3980	2	People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it. Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it.           I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yea some parents dont care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school.     Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not. Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions. Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books.     This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your childs school	3	2	2	2	3	2
3997	2	"If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is. Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to."	3	2	2	3	3	2
4003	2	"First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this?     Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship"	4	4	4	4	4	4

4012	2	"My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials"	4	3	3	3	4	4
4017	2	"There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do.     If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many differnt things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person whouldnt be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive.     So what if a book found offensive was removed? there are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using wemon, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life.     No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child 'safe', just will not work these days. No matter hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next vorner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensiv and teach their children to do the same but, just beacause someone @MONTH1 not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's childer will not eiuther"	3	4	2	3	3	2

4027	2	"I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove. I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kid's dont like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us.      If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glade people invited these thing's. I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring.     Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entataining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, glossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better.     It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures. Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things.     Hope you get something out of what i wrote. This is how i feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books alot.

Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight.       Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator.      Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.       I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future"	5	4	3	3	4	3

I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it."	3	3	3	3	3	4
4034	2	"I believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate.      Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways. But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book.      When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse.      So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head.     As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing. Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older.     I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older."	3	4	3	3	3	3
4039	2	"Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section. Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age.  Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.     In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section. For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores.     Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.     Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement. So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music.     As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age."	4	3	3	3	3	3
4045	2	"Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries.     A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries.     Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library."	3	4	4	4	4	4
4050	2	"Somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexualy things can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music but noting like that becasue I think it should not be in music and books. One day I Think the @CAPS1.S.A will be ran by a woman.      @CAPS3 is noting wrong with that. Woman have the same rights as @CAPS2 do. @CAPS3 is some people that think woman are just @CAPS3 slaves, that is dead wrong. Woman and @CAPS2 are the same no matter what people say.      Katherine Paterson as the right idea though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say other because @CAPS3 is some people out @CAPS3 who just care about them selfs and acted what ever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. @CAPS3 are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That it why i think we should be able to take it off the shelfs     @CAPS3 was this one day I was in @CAPS4-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover becasue one day they @MONTH1 not be like @CAPS3 parents and have all the money in the world.      It @MONTH1 seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs becasue we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life.          All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what @CAPS3 wear and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid but when i see someone who drives a new car worth @MONEY1 it really makes me think about how someone as the money for this car and everything else."	2	2	2	3	3	3
4053	2	"Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library."	4	3	2	2	3	2
4055	2	"Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation."	4	5	4	4	4	4
4066	2	"Libraries have books, magizines, movies, ect.The library is a wonderful place to read in a quite place.It can also be an offensive place to some people.They think they can complane and bikker about it, But should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose oppenion is it anyways.          If I found an offensive book, movie, or magizine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently its not a bad thing because if it was they wouldnt have it on a shelf. So if I got offensive by it I wouldnt look at it or pick it up. I mean its that simple.A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many diffrent people like diffrent books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put what ever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people.           With my experences in a library nothing has came across to be offensive to me. Im a kind of person that dosen't care. However I have seeen so books ware the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also @CAPS2 seen a book ware the author is writting about the black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it witch is a major racism to black people.                   It could be a unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and a inapropreate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents .Or it could even be in a magizine. But why should the books magizines and ect.. be tooken off the shelfs when its not effensive to all people? If the libraians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left. Everyone has diffrent things that can offend them. If you dont like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you.      Books, movies, magizines and ect are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are then dont look at it or read it. Its that simple get it or dont"	3	3	2	2	3	2
4073	2	"I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that.  Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us.  Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not.  If they do not want to, then they do not have to.  Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.       Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be, they do not have to read it.  I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.     However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there.  Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them.  But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.       Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example.  In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly.  But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience.  She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help.  This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through.  Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.     Books are not the only things that might offend some people.  In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively.  Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned?  No, and why might that be?  Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.     Another place is the @CAPS2.  If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books.  Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2?  No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too.  If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library.  Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics.  I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer.  Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.         So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained.  Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from.  Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out.  After all, we are not forced to do anything.  All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own"	4	5	5	5	5	5
4074	2	"Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive.  Books, movies, and music were created for a reason.  It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge.  Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.     Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive.  Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society.  If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated.  The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.     Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information.  People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing.  The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make.  It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves.  If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material.  Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.     Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought.  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone.  It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening.  Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.     Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us.  Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material.  There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.     Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason.  Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too.  Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech."	4	5	5	5	5	4
4077	2	"To remove or not to remove     Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.     To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not. personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books. But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion.     Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not. personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world auccualy is. It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress.      Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them.      In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo"	3	2	2	2	3	2
4088	2	"It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive.          There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression.      People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If  libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material.      Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered.      'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library"	4	5	5	5	5	5
4089	2	"I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion"	4	4	4	4	3	4
4098	2	"I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.

Because If are kids pick them up there will be @CAPS1, and crime. Some people mite ask how do I know this well say you see this cd cass that says black mans only cd. And a white boy picks it up well then a black kid sees it and that white boys hand the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand. Therefore starting a fight."	2	1	1	1	1	1
4128	2	"Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be  some type of censorship in libraires to protect the offended people . I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music. After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights.       Many authors , artist and musicans have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work ,a form of self expression. They do not publish their work to offend people , they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library.     Over many years most libraries have devloped and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This system seperates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instince if you are looking for a mystery book , you would find it in the non fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.      Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it  do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If everytime that happend there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.      In the end a book is a book , music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books of the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write , musicans play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything  it does not matter what is offensive to people , they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library"	4	4	3	4	4	4
4129	2	"'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2'     @CAPS3 is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. @CAPS3 is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @MONTH1 be disturbing to certain people, but @CAPS3 does not mean that everyone finds @CAPS3 offenive.     Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project. The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found @CAPS3 disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @CAPS3 interesting. @CAPS3 was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me.     Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, @LOCATION1, found @CAPS3 disturbing to look at some pictures because @CAPS3 showed blood. Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While @PERSON1 found @CAPS3 disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @CAPS3 was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper.     I believe @CAPS3 is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @CAPS3. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource"	4	5	4	4	4	3
4133	2	"With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them.     If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.     With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive. Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community"	4	5	5	4	5	5
4138	2	"What would you say if your library  was censored? Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library.     My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.      The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area.     The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You @MONTH1 please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action.     Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into section by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.      With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library"	4	3	3	3	3	3
4139	2	"Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials.     Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things.     Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of @LOCATION2, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events.     Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold"	4	3	3	3	3	4
4142	2	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?	4	3	3	3	3	3
4153	2	"I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like."	3	4	3	4	4	4
4165	2	"It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it."	5	4	4	5	5	5
4168	2	"This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries. Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library.      Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all.       There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't.     So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around."	4	3	3	3	3	3
4169	2	"Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved"	4	4	3	4	4	4
4171	2	"Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.      If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.      Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.      When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.     These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else"	4	3	3	3	3	3
4180	2	"I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section"	4	4	5	4	4	4
4190	2	"@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'.     Censorship, what does that mean to you?  To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us.     In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us?  In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @CAPS1 now?  Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are"	4	3	3	3	3	3
4192	2	"I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the lilbrary if they are offensive. Some peole take things wrong and lilbraries could have issuses. Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves.   First, some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses. If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite. Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them. It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people.   Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel home bond the more they will come.   Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too. If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock.   In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it. somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin. So before you make your decision thing would you want it done to you"	4	2	2	2	3	2
4195	2	"There are many forms of entertainment in the world today.  Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio.  While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive.  When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive.  A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about.  There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.     The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon.  No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music.  If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it.  Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong.  There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people.  To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task.  Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries.  If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book.  The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it.     Everyone has a different view on things.  Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different.  This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people.  For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on.  This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy.  If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it.  Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong.  There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public.  People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it.  If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one.  No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to.  Also, the book @MONTH1 be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong."	4	4	4	5	5	5

I know alot of people couldn't handle being bored. I know I couldnt handle it if all I was bored all the time because someone took away music. Now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. None would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for @NUM1 hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read? I'm thinking you would be really bored im guessing."	2	1	1	1	1	1

There @MONTH1 be something that you like in a book that you don't like in a movie, and there mmay be something that you like in a movie that others @MONTH1 not like in a book that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf.     About magazines if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at then yes they should be taken off the shelf I mean come on now it's a libary there should be certain things that are up there that's al I'm saying"	2	1	1	2	2	2
4213	2	"Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another?    Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth.    Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know.    How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man.    In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured."	4	5	4	5	4	4
4214	2	"People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information.     Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it.     Children in libraries should be supervized. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. @CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnacy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children.      Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get thier friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children.     Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervized. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children."	4	3	3	3	3	3
4217	2	"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away."	6	6	5	5	5	6
4232	2	"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea."	4	4	4	3	3	3
4233	2	"All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @CAPS2 shows, and music. It wont even phase anyone anymore."	3	2	2	2	2	2
4236	2	To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out. having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not. Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts. Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department.	2	1	1	1	2	1

But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person.      No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.

4256	2	I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say.      But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive.     Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading.      I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that.      This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all.     I really feel like am on both sides	3	2	2	2	2	2

4266	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,           I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible."	3	4	3	4	4	3
4272	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed.     One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school.     Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion.     This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem.     Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem"	4	4	3	3	3	3

People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner.  If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate.  Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.  Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do.  Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention.  When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right.  People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard.      I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner.  Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive.     I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff.

But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right.  In all reality though, how is this helping anyone?     By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn.  By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think.  If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things.  When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual.       Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think.  By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think.  And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. How is that fair?      So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this.  Teach your children to be careful in what they read.  If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book.  Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it"	4	3	3	3	4	3

One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all.     The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things. Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library. They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures.     Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading. Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book.     Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them. Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies.     In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all. They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff."	4	3	3	2	3	2
4281	2	"Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	4	2	2	3	3	3
4283	2	"Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversey fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts."	4	3	3	4	3	3
4284	2	"No I @CAPS1 not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason. Sure some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is gonna eventually here, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with."	2	1	1	1	3	1
4289	2	"As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?    I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.     Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship"	4	4	4	4	5	4
4290	2	"Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?'                                               Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children.                                           'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did.                                                         There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life.               I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries."	4	5	5	4	4	3
4298	2	"In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun. Some like to go to movies. Others perfer a nice walk through the park. Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want.          The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not. Its not fair to those who want to read it. I find it very dumb.     The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it. This is a very simple an straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it. If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it. Its just that easy.     The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read. Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny. If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off. If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs. Its not right and its not fair.          We should be able to read what ever we want. Its our right to read it. Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it. That is the way life works."	4	3	3	3	4	3
4299	2	"If you take offense to certian things, you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it. Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first.     Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended. You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future.     You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view. They both could have good ideas and functions to them.     Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them. Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad. Sometimes they can even make you stess a little.     If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them."	3	2	2	3	3	3
4302	2	"The offensive things found in a library. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out.     The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it.     They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it.      Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult.     Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library.     So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do. Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections"	3	2	2	3	2	2
4304	2	"In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves"	4	4	3	4	4	4
4305	2	"Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either. There is music and magazines too. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books,  biographies, autobiographies, etc. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions.      There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and @MONTH1 need it for something they are doing. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book @MONTH1 be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book.      This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or @MONTH1 find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library.     A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier.      I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people @MONTH1 find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing. Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy"	4	4	4	5	4	4
4310	2	I belive that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the united states of @LOCATION1 for there music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.	2	3	2	2	3	2
4315	2	"Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it. Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them. Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days. I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information. The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly. Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times invloving school. Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book. For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is. So why take that information away from me. Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from. Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are."	3	3	2	3	3	3
4317	2	"I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them. we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.      As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television.     With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards. We all know about @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, but think about all of the magazines that we dont see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out."	3	2	2	2	3	3
4323	2	"Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not? Many people have there own personal view on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc. that they themselves have purchased to get. Now they want them cenored? i don't think that is very right.          Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section. The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries.     Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something. Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine"	3	4	3	4	4	3
4324	2	"I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read."	3	3	2	3	3	2

If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad.@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad,but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie.

That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come in the library looking for a book that they want. If that person can find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where. Then the library could start losing bussiness.     Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing. What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home. They can come do there research and rent books.     Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is there only place. Little children go to the library looking for books and etc. to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying. If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost. Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book.     In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc. should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them."	3	2	3	2	3	2
4332	2	"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem."	4	5	5	5	5	5
4334	2	"Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library? No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's.     I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read. I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids. Parents do the samething.      People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time. I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out. There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints.     Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before. People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal. Its not like they are watching anything bad. They mostly have kid movies not bad ones.     Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids? In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody."	3	2	2	2	2	2
4338	2	"The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf .     I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive.     Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to.     On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person.      But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf. that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines"	3	3	2	3	3	2
4340	2	"Censorship for the future kids of america.    Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie. That is how it should have always been."	3	2	2	2	2	3
4344	2	"In many @CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @MONTH1 find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     There is a reason that @CAPS1 libraries are called @CAPS1. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @CAPS1 library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' section of your library. For example: @PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' sections or even the '@CAPS3' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the @CAPS1. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big @CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself."	4	5	4	5	5	4
4350	2	"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it"	4	4	5	5	4	4
4358	2	"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want"	4	4	5	4	3	3

4371	2	"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion.     The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.      The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.      The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.      No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens"	4	4	4	4	5	4
4382	2	"I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books.  However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. because they will separate be washig some bad things and they will be a bad idea"	2	1	1	1	1	1
4383	2	I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not	3	2	2	2	2	2
4389	2	"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries."	4	4	3	3	3	3
4392	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away."	5	4	3	3	4	3
4395	2	I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.	3	2	2	3	3	3
4403	2	"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf."	4	4	3	4	4	4
4409	2	"Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea.      To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. @MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person?     There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever. Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways.     Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie. This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section.      In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever"	3	3	2	2	2	2

Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today"	4	4	3	3	4	3
4412	2	"READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released."	5	3	3	4	4	4
4420	2	"It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor.     Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark.     Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned?     Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty."	5	6	5	5	6	4
4426	2	"There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see. Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children. Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want. If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product.           Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is? Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit.     If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment.      There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things"	3	3	3	2	3	2
4433	2	"Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable."	4	3	3	3	3	3
4456	2	"Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive? Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that age group? Should them type of things but in the @CAPS1 with children? Should they be in @CAPS1's period?                                                                     I thing that the @CAPS1 should have all type of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books. But I also think the @CAPS1 should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at. Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes.                  The @CAPS1 should put people ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the @CAPS1. Because then you would no how old they are . And only @NUM1 years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes. But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it . And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for.           One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves because there are so people that comes to the @CAPS1 just to read them books. And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home.          I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the @CAPS1. Because it give me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1. And the thing's that was named make the @CAPS1 so fun an peaceful.  The @CAPS1 is a place were you can come and whine your day down. With out them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring. People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the @CAPS1 and look for that offensive stuff."	3	3	2	2	2	2
4463	2	"Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship.."	4	3	3	4	3	3

Yes their should be restictions on some things but to solve the under age buying just make people use their @CAPS1!         By doing this I think this would solve alot of issues, taken it all away would be alittle to serious for just some magazines or moives.So keep doing what your doing just set a higher restiction on sells and things should be just fine !                              from your dearly,                                             zack"	2	1	1	1	1	1
4468	2	"Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours."	3	4	3	4	4	4
4470	2	"Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive"	3	3	3	4	4	3
4473	2	"Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?        I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!           Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it.           Now that you read what  I had to say, what do yu think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!"	4	3	3	3	4	3
4475	2	I dont think people should remove the books and movies and music cause its the peoples choice to read and listen and watch the things that that get.      Why should people change cause other people can't handle what the stuff has on it. If the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can its not other peoples choice.     The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. People will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too.     Like I said its the people who choose what they want to watch or listen or read and it is nobodies elses choice to say so. The people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they.     This is what i think of this essay it will be up to the people to choose what they want the listen and hear too.	2	2	2	1	3	3
4478	2	"Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years.     Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races.     A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1.This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught.     Many other books exist as these. But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me.     There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people"	4	3	3	4	4	4
4480	2	"When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.    One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.     The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.      The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.     Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does"	4	4	4	5	5	5
4492	2	"Every we go there is censorship. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read.       Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from any thing we read.     There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic. If they read themselves they would learn alot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life.      It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent.     I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines. These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see. It should be up to the children what they read."	3	2	2	2	3	2
4494	2	"Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library"	4	3	3	3	4	3
4497	2	"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them"	4	5	5	5	5	5
4499	2	"I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no. I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive? Just ignore it.      I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.      People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict. It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?     I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading"	4	4	3	3	3	3
4501	2	"When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from.  There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc.  But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing.  There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience.  The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake.     Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well.  For example, an explicit music album.  If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile.  By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in library's.  For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch.  Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate.  Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie.  This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch.  So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music.  There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book.  There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements.  By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.      For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed.  If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for.  Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc."	4	5	5	3	4	3
4505	2	"Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library.     I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back.      I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries"	3	2	2	3	3	3
4510	2	"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools"	4	3	3	3	3	3
4516	2	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.     First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.     Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.     I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.     At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now	3	3	3	3	3	2

Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.     Call me old fashoned but, I beleive in freedom of speach and the freedoms that we have lost solders over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every @DATE1 of the week is wrong but, you dont see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they dont like.      so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldent be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this."	3	2	2	2	2	2
4526	2	"' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing.      I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things.'"	3	2	2	2	3	2
4534	2	"Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left!      If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the @CAPS1, some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the @CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the @CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library.     There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact."	4	4	4	4	4	4
4536	2	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.

4538	2	"Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.       I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.      You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.      I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.     Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children"	4	4	4	3	4	3
4544	2	"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need ."	3	2	2	2	3	2
4549	2	"What I belive is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book, is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries are sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there should'nt be a problem.      There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world, that is why there are so many differnt kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child. Yes it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by them selves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book.           Many children these days are getting bullied or pick on, and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child some where in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them.      You should stop and think if you was a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there is negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarassed of the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel.      Think about you opinion, does anyone care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trush? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion?"	3	2	2	4	3	4

For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it.     No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions."	3	2	2	2	3	3
4552	2	"There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue.     On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it. @NUM2 which is parental guidance or @NUM3 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content.     I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves.      There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa.      That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views"	3	3	3	3	3	3
4559	2	"As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but not all. I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote.     People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.      By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.      In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section"	4	3	3	3	4	3
4563	2	"There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items.     One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents.     Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it. That decision, however, is up to the parents.     Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents.     There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out."	3	3	3	3	4	4
4567	2	"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries"	5	4	4	4	4	4
4568	2	"Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.     Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.     No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.     A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left."	4	3	3	3	3	3
4570	2	"Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book, @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs. But if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way."	2	2	2	1	2	1

Students must the right to remove the book from the library if he or she gets offended, or sometimes if there is a student who has came from a different @CAPS2 and they might get offeneded by the movies or music that are in the library.      Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some book that are offensive to some student, and if one student find something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelve. Many students like fiction books, which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him. School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life.      Music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library. Most common type of music that you can find in the library is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 music. Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry and bad words, racistism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not apporpriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library.      Movies are also carried in some library, but not every library carries a movie. Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be apporpriate for some childrens who are at school. You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places. Movies might carry some kind of rasictism in them.     Library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be apporpriate for yourself or for students who read those books. These movies, books or music can carry abusive language or something that is rasict to some people who came from a different @CAPS2. Student should have the right to remove something that is not apporpriate in school use, such as, books, music and movies, if they contain something that is not suppose to be in it, you should remove it"	3	3	3	2	3	3
4574	2	"Where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3     @CAPS4 up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"	4	3	3	3	3	3
4585	2	"Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries"	3	3	4	4	3	3
4590	2	"I say tht they shouldn't take off books that are found affensive and im going to say why I think that.I think that they shouldn't take off those books because thats the way it was written, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it.Another reason they shouldn't take it off its because a author wrote it but im sure that he didn't think that a person was goin to find it offensive.My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf its because the book might be really good and interesting, except for tht one person that thinks its offensive.I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so."	2	2	2	2	2	2

Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf?     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't.     Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way.    There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it.     Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?"	4	3	3	3	3	3

Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's there religion. It would just go to show that one mans garbage, is another mans tresher.     It would also be braking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech. It would silense all the great artist out there, trying to be herd. They should be able to write, sing, or film what ever they want. It is their right to do so.

4601	2	"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it"	3	4	4	4	4	4

I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what.     My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read. When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans. If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced. But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff. their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them. movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library. if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in. Music is passion to most people. most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that. their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again.

I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw.      Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing"	4	4	3	4	4	4
4616	2	"I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship, it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them.     What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways.      I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That @CAPS1 just how people are and were.      Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual.     Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that @CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books"	4	4	3	3	3	3
4618	2	"To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world.     Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear.     Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into. That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can"	3	2	2	2	2	2
4621	2	"Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.      Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age"	4	4	3	3	4	3
4633	2	"Books, magazines and misic should be removed if it has something offensive to the person or the child. Books, magazines, music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination and as they grow or are thinking that its a right way to do things. All this things that are not for a proper use shoud be displade of were no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hust people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use.      Books magazines that have no material use and its used for pornagrafi or something else should be taken off shelfs. Kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Book magazines and music provide imspiration not to come to the fact that it comes to peoples distraction.thesse are way that by sometimes not knowing u hurt ur love one because of what u see, read or hear.this can the be the biggest effects on people.      The supplies you get like books, magazine, and music arent helping you and are caousing more problems in your life they should be take of markets. Also people sometimes decied to buy them beacause of what the pictures have instored for you in a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken of shelfs is the thought that u can get by looking and hearin and reading.This are all bad things for anybody to be ready or lisening to.     I belive that books, magazines and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it dosnt help you in any way. Also things that arent used for good are not use full.In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music sometimes it can take you to suiside or into making something cazy that later on you will regret.This is why nun od thoese things are use full for a person or a child     In conclusion, I think that books, magazines and music that are not use full shoul be taken of shelfs and should be putting things that do help the mind.Things that are not resorsful for a person mind should be put away.All this things came into not having estability in life and cometing rong steps that take you into failure.Finaly I think that all unresorsful books, magazines and music should be put away"	3	3	2	2	2	1
4635	2	"Censorship in libraries is good in some ways.  People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books.      Things that offend people: for instance, a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous. either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive.     My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offinsive. That word just really isn't nice.      People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.     All together, just about everything is offinsive to somone out there. If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed, then there would hardly be any books movies ect., and not only that it would suck all together"	3	2	2	2	3	2
4638	2	"In the book fahernheit @NUM1 all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an improtnat part of our lives. Some materials do need to be cencored because it might offend some people that are all ready have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored. Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one, but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason?"	2	2	2	1	1	1
4640	2	"Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I dont think that is right. Thats just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library?   A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now?   Taking away music? kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it.   Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there.   So i think taking books, music, magazies, and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do. Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore."	4	4	3	3	3	3
4644	2	"Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1"	2	3	3	3	4	3
4647	2	"Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves.     Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them.      Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable. Teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library.      Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stoten from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library.     Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain material  such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries."	4	5	5	5	5	4
4655	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No I do not. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it.     I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey. We can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you.      I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me. Or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true.     I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it. Because then things can get out of control.      That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries. Mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions"	4	4	3	4	4	4
4656	2	"I think there should be no books taken off the shelfs. Somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people. Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.     Maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids. Maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world. The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence. That should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. The book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds. It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life.     I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts. These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directiors/ writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs.      Why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others? I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs. Let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset. I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself. If they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self."	4	3	3	3	3	3

4659	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it."	3	4	3	4	4	4
4667	2	"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you."	4	5	5	5	5	4
4669	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do believe so. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid see's a movie that involves violence.     One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive  because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occurr while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion, race, or anything that involves to there personal life. That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended.     Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie. Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what there kid's are watching. So it's important for them to learn and watch for there kids. In movie's anyone can  see a lot of bad thing that can effect anyone or can offend anyone. So I think that they should not have certain  movies on the  shelves that can harm or offend certain family or parents, espicially there kids.     Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that ocurr around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has soemthing bad inside. That's why they shouldnt have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn't buy certain type of magazines because they never know what there child can expect to see.          So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain book, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even my reading a book. It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themself that, before they read a book or see a movie. So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves."	4	5	4	4	4	3
4676	2	"OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!!   Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now? They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not! The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things.       I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same. Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that! Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc.      I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all. Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !@NUM1"	3	2	2	2	2	2
4681	2	"I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!"	3	2	2	3	3	3
4686	2	"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn"	4	5	4	3	4	3
4695	2	"Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content?  In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people.  People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive.  Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.     People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines.  What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers.  There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children.  Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong.  Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries.  Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children.  Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.     An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone.  It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular.  How does this pertain to offensive books?  Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm.  Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose.  Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet.  Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns.  Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about.  The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.     Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book.  A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable.  Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read.  Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them.  Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been.  I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring.  Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.     There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today.  Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book.  Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others.  You have the choice not to read them or to read them.  Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1.  It does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times.     Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book."	4	5	5	4	5	4
4710	2	"I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer. I personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake.     'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body. Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored. If your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this.     Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library. The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area.     libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you."	3	2	1	1	2	2
4714	2	"I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it.            I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The book uses the '@CAPS3' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5.             From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life.             Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed"	3	4	3	4	4	3
4715	2	"Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library.  In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left.  The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question.  There is a simple answer to this question.  It should not be censored.     Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize.  The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries.  As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.     To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works.  Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues.  These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.       The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with.  This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored.  The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line.  Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages?  In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind.  Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.     Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left.  This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone.  As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist.  It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'"	4	5	4	4	5	5
4717	2	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave.          If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it.	2	3	2	2	2	2
4718	2	"If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. @NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time"	4	4	4	3	4	4
4722	2	"In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it."	2	2	1	2	3	2
4725	2	"Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs.      @CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide!"	4	3	3	3	4	4
4730	2	"Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists.

4736	2	"books, music, movies, magazine, ect. shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or herd. they should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history. it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them. without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go. that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library."	3	2	2	2	3	2
4742	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1     @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quit often, and things that I see in there I feel souldnt be in there. Like the movies. Theyre okay, but theyre all sitting together. So that means me bein a young lady. I see things that I know my mother wouldnt approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there.     I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them. Thats not right at all.     Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.         I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all.      Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What im just askin you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make there own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing and i kno many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children and a library with alot of censored things in there doesnt sound like the best. That just mean they are startin off wrong.                                              Sincerly: A student who believes in changes"	4	5	5	4	4	4
4750	2	There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books. Would you really want to take that from the people? If my arguement did' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter.	2	1	1	1	2	1
4752	2	"Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  I believe that libraries should not have censorship.      I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries."	4	5	5	4	5	4
4769	2	"I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries"	3	2	2	2	2	2
4772	2	"Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies.  Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want.  Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children.  Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone.     Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life.  Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory.  Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else.  Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness.  Everyone finds something offensive.  Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter.  For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple.  Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range.     More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced.  Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading.  By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like.  This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people"	3	3	4	4	4	3

If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching."	3	2	4	2	2	2
4777	2	"Different Then Everyone Else     @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive?My opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them.There are so many small things the can be offensive like books, movies, and music.Its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for thier one belonging.      Books can be a way to learned new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more then what can a person with there own words can.There are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids.I know the a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf  about '@CAPS2', when they are getting @CAPS2.Sure is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it.Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2?A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it,and you dont even have to talk about it.      Movies are similar like books,in one way the you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone.I know the some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Its a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to does people. And even it a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to belive it. A good way it to watch the movie and learned from it.      Music has  a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's thats their way of express their own feeling about stuff.We can't really discriminate anyone for their own belives. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, the use a lot of bad words in his song but thats how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you its more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinon then others.      My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music  about bad stuff don't assume I'm  going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it. Remember its your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you"	3	3	3	2	2	2

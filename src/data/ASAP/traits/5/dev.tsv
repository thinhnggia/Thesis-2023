Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in."	2	3	3	3	3

The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, that made the author look up to them. The author even says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" After all a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others."	2	3	2	3	3

He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family.

""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met.

I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.""

The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays.""

He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think."	4	2	2	3	3
12093	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2	2	3	2
12096	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	0	0	1	1

Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. The author shows a feeling of a warm, wonderful household with music and cooking. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice warm child hood here: ""Here, the innocence of child hood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author enjoyed a nice childhood, filled with friends and family, all enjoying the wonders of their home. That is how the author sets the mood."	3	2	2	3	2

It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3	2	3	3	2

Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice.

That also shows how grateful the author is. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly."" That shows how grateful the author is because he thanked his parents more than once. Finally in paragraph @NUM4 the author explains how he learned the true definition of family. Then it says ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" That also shows how grateful the author is because it says how he is gracious for his neighborhood and the many things he learned. The mood the author created is very grateful."	4	3	3	3	3
12146	5	"The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching."	2	1	1	2	2
12151	5	"The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family."	3	3	3	2	3
12154	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger."	4	4	4	4	4

Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like "passionate Cuban music filled the air" and "the congregation of family" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with "extended family" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author.

Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about them. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has alot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set.

12247	5	"As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them."	3	2	2	3	3

The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, into a home. Accomplishment, is the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives""."	3	2	2	3	2
12353	5	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez protrayed very strongly in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratitude.

Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" Narciso ""will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is greatful for what they did for a better life, for showing him happiness, family, love and sacrifice. Overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude."	3	3	3	3	3
12359	5	"In this selectian family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life ful of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitily created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one."	3	2	1	2	2

12393	5	"Based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction. It was filled with love and satisfaction because Narciso and family loves everyone for who they are. People from all over came and be apart of the family and it was alright with them.

In there neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. They were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family.

12407	5	"The author definatly created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over. Their families love turned the house into the home he loves. They brought the culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and ""the very heart of which was the kitchen.

That's how the mood describes the @CAPS1 memoir of Narciso Rodriguez background and his family."	1	1	1	2	2
12413	5	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."	2	2	1	3	2
12418	5	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	3	3	3	3
12422	5	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was."	4	4	3	3	3
12428	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship."	2	2	1	2	2

At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems.

There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1."	3	2	2	1	1

Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life.

12555	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his family factually, as well as loving and inviting. In paragraph two, Narciso tells how his family interacted in their house. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso lists the facts about his childhood. The memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him. The powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness. The word he uses can tell they are from the heart, the memories of @CAPS1 parents as well as the rest of his family, influenced his life, and he learned the true meaning of family."	3	3	3	4	4
12559	5	Narciso mood in the @CAPS1 is him growing UP in Cuba and then moveing to the US. When he is in the @CAPS2.S he finds a house and later in the @CAPS1 he and his famliy makes the house into a home.

12566	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice, and calm. It describs How the famialy let people in their house with open arms and a open door and  that makes me and mybe other people seem the mood is nice. The mood is calm because  it talks about this famialy doing nice thing and there is no yelling no fighting and I find the to be nice, and calm."	1	1	2	2	2
12567	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life.	2	1	2	2	1
12576	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness."	3	3	3	2	2

12580	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	1	2	2	2	2
12587	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."	3	2	2	2	2
12611	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	2	2	1	2
12615	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	1	2	1	1
12619	5	"One of the moods in the memoir was greatful. Narciso greatful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also he loved that his parents thought them so many things. I mean that he always had something to do. He was always happy to be around family and friends."	4	3	3	2	2
12633	5	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him."	3	3	3	3	4
12638	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back and makes the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful."	3	3	4	4	3
12656	5	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	2	3	3	2
12659	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1). He had a: ""Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants.."" (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people."	2	2	1	1	1
12664	5	"The mood in this memoir is very happy. It kind of shows how lucky we are, by showing how greatful they are to be hear in @LOCATION1. The mood is also joyful."	1	1	1	1	1
12670	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" The author was very happy and grateful. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This is a happy setting where the author grew up in. The author was also very grateful to his parents. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This shows the emotions the author felt growing up."	2	2	2	3	2
12674	5	"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir."	4	3	4	4	4
12676	5	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."	2	1	1	2	1
12692	5	"The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author @CAPS2 this mood with his quotes that @CAPS1 puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 is grateful for all the people that @CAPS1 now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That @CAPS2 right in the quote that @CAPS1 is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show @CAPS1 is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote @CAPS2 that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need""."	3	2	3	3	2
12696	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood was a good feeling. To explaination of how he lived @NUM1 reality. Having family come live with you till they get back on their feet. Having family all around you. Realizing you turned your ""house into a Home"". Endless celebrations that encompassed, both form a a backdrop to life in their warm home. ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."	3	2	2	2	2
12698	5	"The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2	2	2	2
12705	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	3	3	2	3
12706	5	"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful."	4	3	3	3	3
12709	5	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3	3	3	2
12710	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him. They didnt just tell her what to do, they showed her. When he talks about the @NUM2 lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live (the essentials to living).  They also showed him the meaning of family. He doesn't just think family is blood related, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of ""family"""" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is grateful. "	4	3	4	3	3

Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people.

""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other.

12741	5	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story."	4	3	3	2	2

Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3	3	3	3

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life.

12794	5	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end.

In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family."	3	2	2	3	3

Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble.

12866	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage… I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	3	3	3	3	2

""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him.

Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to @LOCATION1 to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life.

12923	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable.

Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that.

They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities.

He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work.

The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood.

It also brightened the mood of the whole story. The overall mood of this memoir, I feel, was clearly depicted."	4	3	3	3	3

13463	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. The authors states, ""… originally from Cuba… could afford to move into a modest… apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house is like and how even though they are New Jersey, their house still feels like cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, ""… I learned the real definition of ""family""… I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3). This quote shows, that the author has learned all the important skills in life. Thanks to his family he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect. Clearly, there are many ways the author created the mood for the excerpt."	4	3	3	3	3
13467	5	"The mood is obvesoly love, and greatfulness. ""(And for which I am exernally greatful)."" The boy is young so he doesn't quite get how big that move for them was. ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" This means leaving family, friends, @CAPS1 new jobs, a house to put over his head, and leaving their home to give a great one for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his cuban life alive. They didn't forget where they came from.Now I think about it one of his moods could be sad because he was the reason for all that happend. What happen if he was never born he would ever never found out what family means. That is why in this memoir has some greatfulness, some love, and that little bit of sadness."	2	2	2	2	2
13470	5	"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.""@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them."	3	3	3	4	4
13475	5	"The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home countrys. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words.

13487	5	"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 I have decided the as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good mood to it. One thing that made the mood good with all the talking about parties. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking. Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day."	3	1	1	2	2
13489	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful. Appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room.

But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.

She also says that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and how she is thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and ""family"" growing where she did. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was one big family. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is greatful for her parents and their love & sacrifice.

13505	5	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them."	3	1	2	3	2

13516	5	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home.

13530	5	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind."	4	3	3	3	3

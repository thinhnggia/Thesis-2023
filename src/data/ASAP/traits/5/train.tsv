11828	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	3	3	3	3

In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning.

The author's ""parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen"" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less is a building.     To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family"" (@NUM2).

Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

That is the mood set by Narciso Rodriguez."	1	1	2	2	2
11915	5	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""…our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States.""

11937	5	"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents.

This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care.

For example, he says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarely until they were able to get ba- ck on their feet."" It is very genorous to help some body in that way.

Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one."	2	2	3	2	2

This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. Those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir."	4	3	3	3	3
12078	5	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very happy. I think it sounds like the child of the greatful family is talking and she is one of the most greatful people I ever read about because she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home""."	1	0	0	0	0
12086	5	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. as the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting."	3	4	3	4	3

12113	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the @CAPS1 is trying to re-create his/her past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."""	1	1	1	2	2
12115	5	"He was thankful his parents moved for him and thinks it was very nice. He said he doesnt think he would do that, so it was meaningful to him. His parents had come to give him a better life, even though they were leaving behind loved ones."	1	1	2	2	2
12116	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him."	3	1	2	3	2

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, greatfulness, and respect @CAPS1 has towards his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be greatful for their love and sacrifice"", meaning the sacrifices parents made for their children. @CAPS1 also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseference... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" @CAPS1 cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that @CAPS1 bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is in paragraph @NUM2, when @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This somes up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him. giving this simple sentence a great meaning."	4	3	3	3	3

Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his... life with his ""family"" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story."	3	2	1	2	2

I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality."	2	2	2	2	2
12180	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1	1	3	2

Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful."	2	2	3	3	2

12223	5	"In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey."	2	3	3	3	3
12226	5	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere.

In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind.

Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them.

For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times.""

This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is ""It was here I learded the true definition of family.""

12564	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""	3	3	2	3	2
12569	5	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times.

Also he says Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen, Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.

12588	5	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well."	1	2	1	2	2

But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometime gets to gether for dinner when they throw a Cuban party for the relitives who arrived to @LOCATION1 from Cuba.	1	2	2	2	2
12640	5	"The @CAPS1 is trying to set a mood. The mood is inviting and how a family can over come difcultys together. ""parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the countrie."" That is showing how open and caring the family is."	1	2	2	1	1

12661	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular becacuse in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he explains his life a little to the reader he explains how they lived in cuba then to america and the boy also explains how he loves his home, and celebration and heritage in america the boy talks with  like same kind of smat tone beacse he's really explaining his like then about really now and hear he likes is so theres no anger in this story.

It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me."	3	3	3	3	3
12679	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives the mood of the author in the memoir was he was thankful for everything he got so like the mood was quite and loving I picked quite because he has grew up nothing really exciting happened in his life he grew up in @LOCATION1 and his parents were from @CAPS1 parents were very nice people and alway wanted to give their kid a better life and he's alway been grateful for his parents they were the originally parents that made his life not that much excitiing and also picked loved as a mood because in the article ""always filled the air with not just scent in misic but life and love.

12684	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In paragraph @NUM1. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""

12686	5	"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence from paragraph @NUM3 supports the author wanting you to feel grateful. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made my mood become happy."	4	3	3	3	2
12688	5	"The mood that they author creates is kind of happy for what he has. ""In our neighborhood, despite costums elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The quote @CAPS1 how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together."	2	1	1	1	1

12699	5	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him His overall tone in the memoir is translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir.     Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of generosity, and care towards family. It is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to gratitude as Narciso thinks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents formed the basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life."	4	4	4	4	4
12701	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atsmothsphere is filled with family and friends also joy and happyness. The considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone also his parents gave up a lot so he could have a good life in @LOCATION1. He is very grateful for his parents bringing him to @LOCATION1 so he could have a good life even though had to leave their life in Cuba to come here for him. This is the mood created by the author in the memoir.	2	2	2	2	2
12712	5	"The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes."	2	2	2	3	2
12715	5	"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. "	3	3	3	3	2
12717	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be describe in many ways. The mood that the author created was confusing. Is confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of the are happyness, proudness, sadness, and other ones. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez life. The mood created by the author can't be describe since there's too many."	1	1	1	1	1
12729	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author shows a very strong mood relating to the piece. The emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude.The mood of this memoir has lots of passion. Narciso talks about his family's passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. That was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). I also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them. The author even describes his community as a ""... a close-knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. The author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. He doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3).The author created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude. All of these emotions are evident in the text."	4	4	4	4	4
12733	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. They always helped out people in need. The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. He said that was one house hold he would never forget.	2	2	2	3	2
12740	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir."	2	3	3	3	2
12743	5	"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them."	3	3	3	3	3
12745	5	"The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends."	3	2	2	2	2
12747	5	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship"" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly"" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were."	3	3	3	3	2
12752	5	The mood in the memoir is alot of things here are some. First it makes a warth feeling. It also makes a happy mood because he says that he cannot thank enough. For what they did for him. And lastly it makes you kind of sad because it talks about people that need help. And it says that they love cuba and wants to remember there heratige. There some moods that this story brings out.	1	2	2	2	2
12753	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3	3	3	2
12758	5	"The mood is grateful, because it shows how grateful he is for his house and all the people that come over and be his family."	1	1	1	1	1
12762	5	"In the memoir the mood that was created by the @CAPS1 was saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family. With out family life would be much harder to deal with."	2	2	2	2	2
12784	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appriciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" and, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 he showed appritation toard his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to @LOCATION1. He talks alot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all cuban, spanish, or Italian imagrents, and they tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word ""family"" means."	4	2	2	2	2
12788	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was emotional because he describes his childhood and how he grew up.	1	1	1	1	1
12793	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in @LOCATION1 This is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in @LOCATION1. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.      Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family ""'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy."	3	3	3	3	3
12799	5	Though out this story there is a certain @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. like how these people got there dream home and this was it.

Where these people learned to love. and the best part having family near by.	2	1	1	1	1
12806	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. For one, the mood is of graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  This feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this envronment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time. The final express of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". These express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood, holding a special place in his heart. These are the descriptions of the mood that is created by the author in the memoir. "	4	3	3	3	3
12810	5	"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness."	4	4	4	4	4
12818	5	"The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood."	3	3	3	3	3
12827	5	"I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times."	2	2	2	2	2
12838	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	3	2	3	3	2
12839	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."	3	3	3	4	3
12840	5	"The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he talks about what he loves, such as Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to form his life growing up. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family. but also represents love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other, and they are all loving of each other. The mood changed near the end as well. It turned into totally love and warmth, but also happiness. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still celebrating the possibilities that are facing them."	4	3	3	4	3

12945	5	"In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each @DATE1 down thecape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear."	2	1	2	3	2

12955	5	"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are.

12957	5	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time.

The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""	3	1	1	3	2

They shared food, shared their homes, and shared happiness between them. There was a certain trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody,"" knowing that they would do the same for [them]."" (paragraph @NUM1) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" (¶ @NUM2) ""innocence of childhood,"" (¶ @NUM2), ""hard working"", (¶ @NUM4), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly,"" (¶ @NUM5) ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity.""

However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hardwork and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents."	4	4	4	4	4

While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america.

She states, ""my mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (@NUM1). The author is grateful because her parents came to @LOCATION1. But she is grateful because they didn't come for themselves, they came for her. They gave up everything they had for her. Next, all her thanking shows her being grateful. The author tells he parents of her ""admiration for their strength and perseverance"" (@NUM2) and has ""thanked them repeatedly"" (@NUM2). The author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents. She is grateful for their perseverance and for their strength through this whole process and thanks them over and over again. Finally, she is grateful when they are leaving their house. She reveals, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4).

The author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1, and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are. They all share a similar culture, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood-relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1."	2	3	3	3	3
12984	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home.

12989	5	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author."	4	3	3	3	3

In conclusion, the auther creates a mood in the memior in many ways."	2	2	3	2	2
12998	5	"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about."	2	3	3	3	2

13000	5	"In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect."	3	4	4	2	3
13004	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness.     One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture.

Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has.      Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are."	4	3	4	4	4
13010	5	The mood is memorable because he loves remebering everything that he did in his childhood. Also he also put the memories that he really like in parentheses. Also he thanked everybody on what he did in his lifetime. That is why memorable is a memory in his lifetime.	1	0	0	1	1

The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family."	4	4	4	4	4

In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking.""When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet.""@CAPS1 example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1.

13607	5	"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one.One example on how its warm is how he discribes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever don."" This is saying that he is greatfull that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life.Thats why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice."	4	3	2	2	3

11832	5	"The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a mixture of both happy and sad because of the way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now but he keeps those happy memories. Most of other ideas like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" makes me feel happy that his parents were so determind.

11838	5	"The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden – red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in."	1	2	2	2	2

Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.

11948	5	"The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him.

11954	5	"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 ""… Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants…"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close – knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."	4	4	4	3	3
11961	5	Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're.  Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like.	1	1	1	2	2
11963	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another."	4	3	2	3	2
11964	5	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him."	3	3	2	4	2
11966	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is in the following. In the first paragraph, it descripes a couple coming to @LOCATION2 from Cuba who settles down and has a baby. Within the story, it describes their life here in @LOCATION2, what their house is like and the importance of cooking and music from Cuba. In Newark, New Jersey this family invites friends and family for dinner and such; the author describes how it brought everyone together and the mood of unity and happiness.

11978	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to @LOCATION1. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life."	3	3	3	4	3
11983	5	"He gives a mood of friendliness and happy memories. He tries to make the reader feel the happy feelings he felt, so that people would understand how he feels and tried to relate to it. Childhood memories are supposed to give those feelings to the reader."	1	1	1	1	1
11987	5	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir."	2	2	3	3	3
11991	5	"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community."	3	4	4	4	4
11992	5	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.	2	1	1	3	2
11999	5	"The mood created by the authar was warmthness. He was so @CAPS1 toward his family moving @CAPS2, he also cared for his parents alot and what they had done for their family. I know this because ""I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home""."	3	1	2	2	2
12002	5	In the passage It shows a child growing up in a lace that he/she thinks Is heaven on earth. The author is trying to show you when you read this and feel a sense of him/she being love did and loving where he/she is. The mood it is creating is happiness also.	1	0	0	0	0

12007	5	"In this memoir of the author creates a clear mood. He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and cuban music. It also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and help others out. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working."	3	3	3	3	3
12014	5	"The mood created by the author is a feeling of greatfulness for his parents.Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with courage. @CAPS2 realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives. His parents had no knowledge of the @CAPS1 language. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, and had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a sense of greatfulness for his parents."	3	4	4	3	4
12018	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good @CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good @CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good @CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy @CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another @CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad @CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad @CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then @NUM1 @CAPS1 in this story, but the most import @CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand @CAPS1 to know in this story, loving."	4	3	3	3	3

12034	5	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."	3	3	3	3	3
12045	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself."	2	1	1	2	2
12047	5	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."	2	3	3	4	4

12060	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."	3	2	3	3	3
12061	5	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating.

Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents.

Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it.

12293	5	"In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life.

12299	5	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting hapiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they keep constant custom of their cultures warmth and detiration. Nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose."	4	3	4	3	4
12300	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.	2	1	2	2	2

12320	5	"In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories.

12325	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home reminds him of his old country.

The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can see why the author is grateful. His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other.The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parent's courage.In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him."	4	4	4	4	4

The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times.

12579	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness Here are my three reasons why I think that First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is.

""In 1961, I was born into this simple house.""@CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family"".Finally, His parents migrated from cuba. They are known as immagrents because they was not born in america, and narciso is proud and honestly happy for them.

12581	5	"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother.

He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir."	4	3	2	2	3

12592	5	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live.

It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive.

The first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @NUM1: ""Passionate  Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @NUM2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home.

12736	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a mood for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love. There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example in paragraph two the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 not be a grateful about simple things like cooking, but the Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed."	4	3	3	3	3

I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2.

12822	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood.  I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, ""I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

12831	5	"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphisization his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that @CAPS1 would not be who @CAPS1 is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home!"	4	3	3	3	3
12832	5	"Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday"". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful."	3	2	3	2	2
12834	5	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is."	3	3	4	4	4
12835	5	"The mood of the author is happy. The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all.

12841	5	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed."	4	3	3	4	3
12844	5	"one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home.

Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2	2	2	2

His word choice and constant repitition of words such as love, grateful, & self-less reinforce this image/atmosphere of love "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"".

Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness.

They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well.

Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it.

In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him."	3	2	3	2	2
13443	5	"Based on the auther in the @CAPS1, the mood created by the author was happy and sad, I sead that the mood created by the auther was happy because he lived in a comfortable with made by thier neighborhood was mostly, Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants at a time, it was no rasism, no segregation he lived his home peaceful, and the sad thing was that NARCISO RODRIGUEZ learned how to love and the the definition of family and about how to love but he saed that he would never how parents turn house into a simple home."	2	1	1	2	2
13445	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember.

13447	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love, caring, and thankfulness. I say this because she really appriciates what her parents have done for her.

Also, ""it was a close knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in need.""; @CAPS1 @NUM2. This shows that Narciso and her family can trust the people in their community which is a thankful mood. Because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them. In the last @CAPS1, it says ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family and I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows how thankful, loving, and caring he is to his parents. Narciso is proud of his parents because they let people stay with them, when they need to..

13465	5	"In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that associates with feelings of family and love. The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community loved each other and help each other, which added to the mood of family and love. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them. This shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood. In 'Narciso Rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love."	4	4	4	4	4

13476	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started of in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is."	2	1	2	2	2

This is how the author set a @CAPS3 of @CAPS2, love, and unity in the memoir."	4	3	3	3	3
13501	5	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir.	1	1	1	2	2
13525	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is humble. He loves him home alot. He loves the scent and the music and culture in his house.

None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his perent's coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his child hood.Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1 to start a good life for their son. This causes the beginning this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood. Paragraph @NUM1 is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. Paragraph @NUM1 talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them. Narciso was happy to be around his family. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final @NUM3 paragraph. Paragraph @NUM4 talks about Narciso's gratitude towards his parents.

13533	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories) The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of racism in the @CAPS1 his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love."" Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love."	3	3	3	3	3
13543	5	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories.

I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid.

11841	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living."	2	2	3	3	2

11850	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. @CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" @CAPS1 learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir @CAPS1 creates a very happy mood."	4	4	4	4	3
11855	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation."	3	2	3	2	2

They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."""	3	2	3	2	2
11863	5	"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them.

He explains that it was filled with cuban culture. Food music and all. Narcisco states in paragraph @NUM1 ""My parents both shared a love of cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That description allows the reader to picture the warm culture of his childhood home.Then, Narciso explains that his home was always open to friends family and neighbors. He explains that they were all united because the country was filled with racism. To overcome that, they needed to stick together.

11888	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring because his mother gave people a home to help them get back on their feet and kept her arms open and door open. Also the mood created by the author in the memoir is thankfulness because the author thank his parents all the time for his life.	1	2	2	2	2
11893	5	"The mood of the memoir by @PERSON1 is love and compassion for his parents. He tells how he grew up with pride for Cuba and how he still loves Cuban music. His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is ""eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it."	3	2	2	3	3
11895	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by himself he creates a tone of love. It is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things. Also that he is grateful and thankful to everything his parent's gave him, as it says in paragraph @NUM1. For example he explains that family doesn't have to be blood related. His parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you. Also in the last sentence it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". So the author's tone for his memoir is love and that he is grateful for everything with his parents."	3	2	3	3	2
11896	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood was well shown in a few ways. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not."" This here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals."	3	3	2	3	3
11897	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidority."" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says. ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being blood related."" This is now the mood created by the author was ""solidarity""."	3	2	2	3	3
11898	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, these are some examples about the mood in the memoir. First you should always be happy no matter what culture your in. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" located in paragraph @NUM1. It doesnt matter what culture you are in. Second, be happy from where you come from. ""I was born into this simple house, situated, in a two-family, blond-brick, building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" located in paragraph @NUM2. You should be happy from what town you are from. Lastly, never forget who really matters. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" located in paragraph @NUM3. You should always be thankful to you parents. In conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir."	3	1	1	3	2
11919	5	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did They are happy of ther home and the @CAPS1 is happy because of his amazing educational options. That is what I would say the mood of this story is.	1	1	1	2	2
11920	5	"During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important."	3	3	3	4	3
11922	5	"No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful @CAPS1 with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was @CAPS2/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood."	2	1	1	2	2
11932	5	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."	4	3	3	4	3
11933	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.	3	2	2	2	2
11939	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was happy, loving, and warm. The memoir is basically about family and how important family is. When you talk about your family, and its culture, you usually dont feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir. the author says things like, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""formed a backdrop to life in our warm home"". The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is very proud and gratefull for. He states in paragraph @NUM1, that his parents, ""kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family.""

But there is no doubt that he aimed for this memoir to be happy and uplifting and truely touching."	3	2	2	2	2
11940	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood."	2	2	3	3	2
11941	5	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun."	3	2	2	3	2
11943	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez, his own memoir, his own memoir, we are told about his child hood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes ""could afford to into a modest three room apartment..."" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood."	3	1	2	1	2
11945	5	"The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir."	4	3	2	4	3
11949	5	"In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodríguez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."	3	3	4	3	3

Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir."	4	4	4	4	4

In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy"	3	3	3	3	2
12205	5	"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how apriciative he was. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off loving and caring mood to the readers."	3	2	3	2	2
12206	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"	3	2	2	3	2

This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S they had no problem finding a home.

I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood."	4	3	3	3	3

Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need.

The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had."	2	3	3	3	3

To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"".

12494	5	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 his family, and how not all family members are blood relitives. Narciso grew up in a house filled with culture and love. His ""young parents created a traditional Cuban home…"" that Narciso would grow up in. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about ""the real definition of 'family.' "" @CAPS1 explains how it there were people of no relation who were considered family. His parents would keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso Rodriguez tells of his home were @CAPS1 learned that a family is a group of people who care for one another, and that is the mood in his memoir."	3	2	2	1	2
12503	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by ""Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer"", the moods created by the author in the memoir are mainly happiness, gratefullness, and being humble. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso mentions alittle bit about his past, and how gratefull he is for what he has today. Narciso knows that his parents try their best to give him a better life. He knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often. No matter  were Narciso was, either a good place or a bad place, he always found happiness. This @CAPS2 doesn't have alot of different moods but few simaler ones. The @NUM1 moods that were mainly presented in the @CAPS2 are happiness and gratefull and all of which came from Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2	2	1	1
12504	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and @CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different that would happen there. like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved. This is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	2	1	1	2	2
12511	5	"The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration."	2	1	1	2	1
12518	5	"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very greatful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is greatful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is."	3	1	2	2	1
12531	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always proud, happy, but never sad. She had a lot of memories from one home."	4	3	3	3	3
12537	5	"In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez enstills a kind of loving mood and a strong feeling of gratitude. He is thankful for the fact that his parents sacrificed their happiness and family for the well-being of their child's (Narciso's) life, as shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: ""I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""All in all, Narciso really shows a feeling of love in this memoir."	3	3	4	4	4
12543	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is by in paragraph @NUM1 it say's ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense The ""family"" had Nothing to do with being a blood relative."" and in paragraph @NUM2 it say's ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with Not just scent and music but life and love It was here where I Learned The real definition of ""family."" These are the mood created by The @CAPS1 in the memoir. "	2	2	2	3	3
12548	5	"The mood in the memoir doesn't change alot. Narciso Rodriguez mood is happy in the end because @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy. The mood is mostly calm & happy because @CAPS1 telling the courage his parents had. Thats the mood the author gave."	2	2	2	3	1
12561	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1	1	2	2
12565	5	"I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them."	2	3	3	2	2
12570	5	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful. @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1, and that even though @CAPS1 didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. @CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family did for her. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. "	2	3	3	3	2
12571	5	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	2	3	3	3	2
12574	5	"The mood created by the author is happy. A sense of security with friends families and neighbors. His parents sacrificed there careers and leave behind friends and family basically starting there life over for the benifit of their children.  Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There she learnd cuban culture such as cooking and music that filted the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of ""families."" Not necessarily blood related, their neighbors were mostly immagrants and when all thoes cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria their land lords daughter came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also her aunts Bertha and Juanita along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Often someone would stay with them temporolly Even in hard times her parents would sacrifice anything for her And for that Narciso is greatful. Greatful to her parents for makeing a simple house into a home."	4	3	3	3	3
12583	5	In This memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives The @CAPS3 explains the definition family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes As the @CAPS3 descriptively went through this the whole time @CAPS5 was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were their for you the one who gave the shoulder to cry on as in the memoir the land lord and his daughter had put food on the table for the @CAPS6 more often than not and How the whole community had been a family because they acted as one reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds some more different from each other stood unified resulting in something more they were a family	3	2	2	3	4
12585	5	"The mood in this selection is prode and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. the first and biggest clue is when the auther states some facts like ""and for wich I am eternaly ""greatful"" and ""witch I adore to this day. Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how prouud she is."	2	1	1	2	1
12589	5	"The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was."	3	2	2	1	2
12597	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."	3	1	2	2	2
12600	5	"The mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness. In the memoir Narciso talks about how greatful he is that his parents left the one place they love, Cuba, just so they can give there children a better life in the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso explains how much he loves his parent for the love and sacrifice they have put forward for example ""In Cuba, Narciso, SR., had worked in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" Narciso loves his parents for this sacrafice they did and the risk they took just so he can have a better life and this is why he wrote this memoir."	2	2	2	2	3
12602	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is."	1	2	1	2	2
12608	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life. And those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir."	4	3	3	3	2
12610	5	"The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning."	2	3	3	3	2
12614	5	"Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help in love by describing it in a nice calm way, of thanking his parents for all they have done for him."	2	2	1	2	2
12621	5	"in This @CAPS1, narciso Rodriguez, The @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 would be a @CAPS5 bit sad, sad because @CAPS3 is taking about her life and how @CAPS3 grows up in a one @CAPS5 Simple house in 1961. her mother didns want her to live anywhere else. @CAPS3 was a only child. and this @CAPS1 tells you mostly about her life. That is the @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 @PERSON2."	1	0	0	0	0
12622	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	2	2	3	2
12623	5	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""	2	1	2	1	1
12624	5	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."	2	2	1	1	2
12625	5	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through. Then he would be joy ful. He would explain what his house would be like. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much. He would explain what loving parents he had. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family.	1	2	1	2	2
12627	5	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart."	2	3	3	2	2
12630	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives."" I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives."" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back."	1	1	2	1	1
12632	5	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you. This author was so greatful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir."	3	3	3	4	2
12636	5	"When reading this memoir it makes you feel something. The feeling you feel is a sort of sorrow. When you feel this it makes you think why did they have to live that way. It also shows that you care for the people Who deal with that lifestyle, @CAPS1 for goodness sake be nice to people dont be nasty because what you do could affect you too."	1	1	0	1	1
12641	5	"The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents welcoming the other imagrents into thier home. And how thier landlords daughter was his first friend. And then how it talks about how thier neigerhood is filled with @CAPS1, Spanish, and Italian imigrents and how they are in that neghborhood because of racism."	2	2	2	2	1
12645	5	"The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life. when he (the author) ex plained how greatful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portreyed a simple but very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was."	3	2	3	3	2
12649	5	"Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraf @NUM3)"	3	3	3	2	2
12662	5	"In this article the author kind of gave a both happy and proud mood. He loved where he came from. Where he was raised, and mainly the life his parents provided for him. He adores his parents and couldn't be more gratefull. They turned a house into a home. They didn't thousands to be happy all they needed was each other...and they did. He is what he is and that's extremly proud of his Cuban life and family."	2	2	3	2	2
12663	5	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is greatful for his education and growing up in @LOCATION1. Also his parents and they're cooking skills. The mood is love and greatfulness.	1	2	1	1	1
12665	5	"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home." ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. "Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. "I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."	3	2	3	3	2
12671	5	"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents. First, he author talks about how her parents give up what ever they had for them. It says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister so he appreciate them a lot for doing all of these for them. Secondly his parents showed him the two lessons abot life. The story states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. This shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him. Third, he learned the real definition of family. It says ""It was where I learned the real definition of ""family."" It shows he learned the most important lesson it this house. These is the mood and how it is shown."	4	3	3	3	3
12675	5	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love."	3	3	3	3	2
12677	5	the mood givin by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy becaus even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1	1	1	1	1	1
12682	5	"In the storie ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think the author was very greatful & happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was lathing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved how to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family."	2	1	2	2	2
12683	5	"The mood that was creat by this author was love. It was love by how he discribed his house. ""The passionate cuban music fill the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Cooking and music you usally associate with love and love is happiness The author also talks about his ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extanded a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind were clearly in need."" This also shows the mood in this memore is love, love of cooking of music and of family. Another place were it showed love in the memore was in this quote. ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood related they still look out for each other and knew they had someone to lean on. The apparent mood in this story was love and the family had much of it."	4	3	3	2	2
12689	5	"In the memoir ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking. First, on page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important  because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion,  in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real deftion of family."	1	2	1	2	2
12691	5	"The mood created by the authour iN the memoir is love aNd happyNess and how family are frieNds. IN the memoir he expaNeds how his mom and dad gave up everything for there child aNd his life.

12694	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez which show what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their love. As said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, thats why at the end of the word ""family"" the i, l, y stand for ""i love you."""	3	3	3	3	2
12700	5	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph @NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life."	4	3	3	2	2
12702	5	"The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well.

He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful."	2	2	3	3	2
12724	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting."	3	2	3	3	3
12730	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life.

He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."	3	3	4	3	3
12742	5	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.

When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving.

He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting. I wonder what he's doing now."	3	2	2	3	2

This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent.

In paragraph @NUM3  it States ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives.

His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1 where Narciso was born. he was raised in the ghetto. When he was living here it was during the time of racism and segregation.

12981	5	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir."	4	4	4	4	3
12995	5	"the mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard. Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family. This is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir."	2	1	1	2	1
12996	5	"In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious."	2	2	2	2	2
12997	5	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The mood was also sad because throughout the whole thing he was saying thank-you to his parents for all his oper tunities. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories. He talks about all his family and friends hangin' out and having a great time. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood."	2	2	2	3	2
13001	5	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then is other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in america. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy.	1	0	0	2	1
13007	5	"The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious. Then he got into a happier mood by telling how his parent and family were good to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy."	2	1	1	2	2
13009	5	"In the memoir the mood is very loving, @CAPS1, and thankfull. The mood is loving in many different ways. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Also @CAPS1 is expressed throughout this memoir. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankfull he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."""	3	2	2	2	2
13013	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."	3	2	3	2	2
13015	5	"The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming.

He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home."	2	2	2	2	2
13019	5	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in @CAPS1 @NUM3, but then later on, we see the family moving to @LOCATION1, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). This sense of family contributes to the heart- warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir."	4	3	3	4	3
13024	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is From Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home.

Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again.

13027	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.	3	2	2	2	2
13034	5	"The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives. He also writes about how he grew up, which is parents teaching him about music, cooking, and family. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children.

In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness."	3	2	2	3	2
13048	5	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show."	2	3	2	3	2
13053	5	"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness. Narciso understands that his parents left everything in Cuba for him. @CAPS1 could tell that his parents love him very much and @CAPS1 is grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. @CAPS1 loved them and they were happy spending time with each other. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving."	2	2	2	2	2
13054	5	"The mood  created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful, and courage. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""  The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents  mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful.  Those are my three quotes and examples of the mood created by the auother in the memoir."	3	2	2	2	2
13071	5	"In the memoir @PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a thankful and gracious mood. Talking about his parents immigrating, @PERSON1 says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life,"" This quote shows thanks because @PERSON1 is glad his parents immigrated to give him a better life.

13078	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3	3	3	3
13088	5	The mood of the author changed during the memoir because in the beginning of the story he had mood of just telling where the character was from and where he was born.

13106	5	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born.

It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail.

Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3).
